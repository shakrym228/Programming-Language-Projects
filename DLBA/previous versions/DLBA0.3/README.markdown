# DLBA 0.3 Programming Language

## Overview

Welcome to **DLBA 0.3**, the next major upgrade of the DLBA programming language.  
This release was developed on **September 6, 2025 (1404/06/15)** by **Mahdi Shakeri**, building upon the previous version (0.2).

## Description

DLBA 0.3 significantly expands the language with richer data types and advanced control flow.  
It now supports **strings, floating-point numbers, `elif` clauses, and logical operators**.  
This makes it possible to write more realistic and complex programs while keeping the syntax simple and beginner-friendly.

## Features
- Added **floating-point numbers** alongside integers.
- Added **string literals** with concatenation support.
- Introduced **`elif`** for cleaner conditional branching.
- Introduced **logical operators**:
  - `&&` or `and` → logical AND  
  - `||` or `or` → logical OR  
  - `!` or `not` → logical NOT  
- Extended comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
- Arithmetic improvements: `/` now performs true (float) division.
- String concatenation with numbers supported (automatic conversion).
- Continued support for reassignment without `let`.
- All previous features from v0.2 are preserved.

## Previous Versions
- **DLBA 0.2**: Introduced `while` loops, Boolean values, and reassignment without `let`.
- **DLBA 0.1**: Introduced conditional statements and comparison operations.
