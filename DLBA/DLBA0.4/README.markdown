# DLBA 0.4 Programming Language

## Overview

Welcome to **DLBA 0.4**, the fourth release of the DLBA programming language.  
This version was developed on **September 6, 2025 (1404/06/15)** by **Mahdi Shakeri**, continuing the growth from previous versions.

## Description

DLBA 0.4 brings **major improvements** to the language design.  
It introduces **comments, functions, and return values**, while improving syntax flexibility and fixing bugs from earlier releases.

## Features

- **Variables**
  - Declare variables using `let` (e.g., `let x = 5`)  
  - Reassign without `let` (e.g., `x = 10`)
- **Data Types**
  - Integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and booleans
- **Arithmetic & Logical Operators**
  - `+ - * / %`
  - Comparison: `== != < > <= >=`
  - Logical: `&& || !`
- **Control Flow**
  - `if`, `elif`, `else`
  - `while` loops
- **Functions**
  - Define using `func` keyword  
  - Call functions with arguments, e.g. `greet("Mahdi")`
  - Support for `return`
- **Print**
  - `print(expr)` or `print expr`
- **Comments**
  - Single-line: `// this is a comment`
  - Multi-line: `/* comment block */`

## Previous Versions

- **DLBA 0.3**: Added strings, floats, `elif`, and logical operators.  
- **DLBA 0.2**: Introduced `while` loops, reassignment without `let`, and booleans.  
- **DLBA 0.1**: Basic variables, assignments, `if-else`, and comparison.
